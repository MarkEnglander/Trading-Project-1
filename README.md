# Trading-Project-1
First Financial Python Project - A basic system to analyse a history of trades from a csv.

This library is one I've made for myself that takes in csv files and creates pdfs summarizing the trades described by the csv files.
It is capable of detecting trades that are made up of more than 2 contracts. 
Its got some functions to make working with csvs of the right format much easier.
